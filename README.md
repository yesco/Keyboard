# Keyboard

Aspiration is to lasercut a functional keyboard with functional electrical switches.

The current experimential ideas:
- lasercut keys with hinges that bounces and make keys movable
- have foamy stuff below
- make electrical connection of wire/paths by a kind of xy-grid
- decode by simple circuit, output serial ascii? esp8266 coprocessor
