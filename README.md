# Keyboard

Aspiration is to lasercut a functional keyboard with functional electrical switches.

The current experimential ideas:
- lasercut keys with hinges that bounces and make keys movable
- have foamy stuff below
- make electrical connection of wire/paths by a kind of xy-grid
- decode by simple circuit, output serial ascii? esp8266 coprocessor

## Cutting

- wood: 2.7mm playwood speed:30 power:55
- plexiglas: according to wiki

## Problems

Sometimes some shapes makes problem.

- Inkscape: Path-ObjectToPath, Extensions-ModifyPath-FlattenBezier 0.1
- Cutter: Select All, make one color, some colors make problem
- The characters seems to make it take forever to "prepare", delete them?
